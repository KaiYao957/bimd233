But anyway I offer apologies for any nonsense filler.</p>

<p>Line #1: I like cat memes. <br> Line #2: For as long as my heart's beating, I will rebel against the irrationality of the world.</p>
Line #3: The world is full of arbitrary, irrational and oppressive rules that make absolutely NO SENSE whatsoever.

<ul>I love: 
<li>Internet</li>
<li>Memes</li>
<li>Enjoying this dumb life</li>
</ul>
<ol>Dumbest life lessons: 
<li>Learn from all those stupid-ass overrated mistakes.</li>
<li>Loss teaches you how to be grateful... by shoving gratitude up your ass! I'd rather crap that lesson out my mouth than to
owe my appreciation to brainwashing! And you should, too!</li>
<li>
We only truly learn life lessons when we are forced to do so against our will, as if we were specifically designed to be tormented forever!
</li>
I hope you got the South Park reference in number two, cuz I crapped that refrence at the right place, the right time! #2 joke intended, and yet another reference to a South Park episode.
<br>I hope you're showing this face:<br>

When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade! Make COMBUSTIBLE LEMONS instead!
