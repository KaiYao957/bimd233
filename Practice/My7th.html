Welcome back, my homie!
To get you started on a new day, how about an uplifting little video of a beary?
</h1>
<video width="320" height="240" controls>

  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">

People always make cool memes out of dogs as well as cats... by taking pictures of them or making videos of them doing cool sh*t
and posting them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social media. Same goes for bears and other animals.
So why not listen to the sound of a horse neighing in happiness?
</p>
<audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

But wait, there will be more to come than just these little animals...

Time to test out a new message. Remember, this is a drill, like all self-studying!
<div>
This is a green box with not only this message, but also a cool picture. In this case, it's a memetic and cute picture of a cat with a Pop-Tart for a body
flying through space with a rainbow trail behind it. I'm talking about, of course, Nyan Cat. So here is your gift!<br>

<p>The green box I mentioned is a special gift to you! I've got more gift boxes coming up!

Here is a ticket to my next trip to my sister's office in Google! There will be very delicious lunch, and lots of utterly decadent snacks! Not to mention
a quiet and lovely room of arcade games and pinball machines! The atmosphere of the office is calm, clean, and comfortable, with a sense of escapism. If you've got lots
of angst to clear up, we can forget about it in our visit to Google! Note: Everyone tells us to stop escaping from our problems, man the f*ck up and face them head on, but
who the f*ck cares?! We can use the serenity of our visit to plot against Big Brother or who/whatever came up with all those arbitrarily retarded, consciously intolerable rules!!!

<div style="border-color:brown">
Wondering why this box's border is brown? It's a cardboard box containing one of the most popular game consoles in recent days...
the Nintendo Switch! What makes it so cool, you ask? It's a combination of home console and portable console! An improvement to the mediocre Wii U,
Nintendo released the Switch to make the next awesome innovation to dominate the game industry, and to rocket back after the Wii U failed to sell as much as Nintendo expected.
It's like a Transformer, morphing from home console to handheld when you like it! Autobots, transform and switch out!

It's much more than meets the eye!
