<h1 style="font-size:50px;">Welcome again to my dirty little page.</h1>
<h2 style="font-size:25px;">I apologize of my rude ranting from my first page. I am sincerely very sorry.</h2>
<h2 style="font-size:75px; color:green">In case you have not heard me, Another apology for not making my sincerest apology clear.</h2>
<p>Anyway, good luck with reading the rest of this humorous page.</p>
<pre>
And again, I like cats.
I like rage comics.
And I like surfing the Internet.
Do you like books?
And would you like to have lunch with me?
</pre>
<p style="color:red;">
This is what I was like on my first page. Also, it's my favorite color.
</p>
<p style="color:blue; font-family:calibri">
This is what I am like on this page. Calm like water. Speaking of water, would you like a glass of water?
</p>
<p style="color:blue; font-size:150%">
Or maybe you want to go swimming in a beach somewhere, or look at a painting of the Pacific Ocean?
</p>
<p style="font-family: arial; color: purple; font-size:50px">
Why not take trip with me to the library or the bookstore and read some cool books? It's cool to learn new things, like I experienced firsthand many times, 
including learning HTML. Maybe you would like to check out a few cool movies like Star Wars or Stanley Kubrick's The Color Purple, purple as this font color?
</p>

Let's go to the local art exhibit, and look at some lovely pictures.<br>
Here's a picture of Vincent Van Gogh's The Starry Night. Perfect for your Windows screensaver.

Here comes my favorite: Let's read come awesome fantasy/sci-fi books!
<br>
I hope you like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings! One book to rule them all...
<br>
You want to make your fantasy book with blackjack and beautiful fancy girls? Sure, go ahead. I really love coming up with cool fantasy stories!
But there are many terrible dangers that lurk within the world of fantasy writing, such as cliches! It's dangerous to write alone, so why not
take a look at this Youtube channel?

<a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ogrx6d9oohf6D42G44j1A>Terrible Writing Advice, for sarcastic information on how to avoid stupid cliches!

</p>
<p style="font-family: arial; color: orange; font-size:175%; text-align:center">
And to finish the day, let's play some awesome video games! I love RPGs (role-playing games)! I love doing quests, fighting challenging monsters, and learning about the fantastic
world the game takes place in! Oh, I forgot that these are only for 1 player. Why not play an MMORPG like World of Warcraft? No interested in fantasy, or RPGs in general?
<br>
Don't worry, because we can play Call of Duty, Halo, or other FPS (first-person shooter) games and enjoy some of that sweet and awesome ultra-violence!
And we can enjoy it with some orange juice! It is so awesome to shoot down your enemies to bits toting an awesome gun, especially when you do it with your droogies on XBOX Live!
<br>
And of course, the orange juice and the way it references this font color, as well as all this nadsat slang I've told you, is a reference the classic,
ultraviolent book/film A Clockwork Orange! By Anthony Burgess! (Or Stanley Kubrick if you are thinking about the film adapted from the book)
<br>
It's super awesome to make references to popular culture and fiction when practicing HTML, especially when you mention a dystopian future dominated by street violence perpetrated
by teenage gangstas like Alex!
<br>
So yeah! What are waiting for?! Let's play a match on Halo or Call of Duty! It will be so exciting to get your adrenaline pumped while packing the big freaking guns and filling your opponent's yarbles with
bullets while listening to classical music! (Especially Ludwig van Beethoven's Ode to Joy, Richard Wagner's Ride of the Vakyries and other badass classical music, gangsta!)
</p>
Thank you very much, homie for visiting my awesome little page! It's not so dirty, after all!
