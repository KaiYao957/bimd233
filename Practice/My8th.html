Have you been enjoying your gift yesterday? You're very welcome. In fact, since I'm extra generous today, I'll be giving you a bonus gift.

Here it comes... *drumroll*

I know you must love art so much, like me! Do you remember enjoying van Gogh's <i style="color:navy">The Starry Night?</i> Or going to a a lovely art museum with me?
I know that you have an admirable appreciation for art, so I'll give you the link to my DeviantArt account! At the time of writing this, there's not that much art on my account, but I will make more art tp come!
Besides, I'm sure you will at least like a few drawings! If you've never heard of DeviantArt, it's a an art website where you can post and share all kinds of cool artwork online,
and view all kinds of art you want! Don't forget to create an account and share some of the art that you've uploaded!
<a href=https://www.deviantart.com/ktheshadowemperor>Enough talk, I'll just show you the link immediately! Here!</a> And don't forget to comment on my art!

Here's some quotes about gifts that you may like.
<br>
<q style="margin: 100px">
The great gift of human beings is that we have the power of empathy.
</q>
<br>
<q style="margin: 100px">
The greatest gift of life is friendship, and I have received it.
</q>
<br>
<q style="margin: 100px">
Nature's beauty is a gift that cultivates appreciation and gratitude.
</q>
<br>
<p>
Speaking of the last quote, why not we take a trip to appreciate nature by going to a park or something tomorrow? That would not only be fun,
but also give us time for reflection and meditation, as well appreciation of nature and, well, life.
</p>

Good thing my bonus gift box wasn't one of the stupid loot boxes that everyone's been complaining about online video games, especially EA (Electronic Arts)
games! Everyone's pissed off about loot boxes these days, accusing game companies for trying to loot as much money as possible from them. And they have
a good reason to whine about it, because of how much loot boxes resemble gambling, making you spend lots of money trying to get the best stuff, or the stuff you like.
Money that could have been spent elsewhere. Seriously, nobody wants to spend a thousand dollars for that one rare and cool cosmetic item/weapon/whatever that could have been
earned in-game with great effort or at least purchased for less! I'd rather spend that money on buying new games, a new computer/tablet/smartphone, a new game console
like the Nintendo Switch I gave you, or even a short vacation!
</p>
<p>
Regardless of what everyone says, you can still complain if you want! Complain about anything! Everyone judges us for being immature, whiny crybabies who don't want to grow up,
but who the f*ck cares?! It's okay to whine like a crybaby about all the bullsh*t that goes on in the world! If you remember me ranting about gratitude and why the most effective way to learn it is through
suffering, then I hope you aren't one of those assholes who say <q>Life's not fair, grow up and deal with it!</q> If you are, then I'm afraid I'll have to take all those gifts from you. If you aren't,
then you're welcome to keep talking and having fun with me. If you really want to rant about something, go ahead. People who rant and complain about all the horrible things in real life have good reasons to do so.
