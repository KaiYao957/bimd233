We are now picking up from what we talked about yesterday, because I had already put enough sh*t on yesterday's page.
But for this time, I'm going to rant about all the absurd self-contradictory nonsense about gratitude, and learning how to appreciate
all the good stuff in life.
<p>
I'm talking about, of course, the harsh reality that we can never ever truly learn gratitude until we lose something precious to us, or some other really bad thing
happens to us. Some bullshit people have to say about "don't take anything for granted"... *grumpy grumbling*
<br>
<q>
You really do not know how good you have it until it’s gone.
</q>
<br>
<q>
Tragedies like this make us re-examine our lives.
</q>
<br>
<q>
Learn to appreciate what you have before time makes you appreciate what you had.
</q>
<br>
<q>
Imagine how hard life would be if we didn’t have access to the Internet or to food or to clean drinking water. (And all the basic stuff that we need to survive...)
</q>
<br>
<q>
Life is too short to waste our time thinking about what we do not have.
</q>
<br>
<q>
Tomorrow is never promised or guaranteed.
</q>
<br>
If I cherish life because it can be revoked and taken away from me so suddenly, without warning, then screw it! I'm f*cking tired of
abiding by those atrocious terms! By saying something like <q>cherish all of life's simple things because there are so many unfortunate souls who
have to endure incredibly horrible hardships just because they've been born at the wrong place at the wrong time to live</q>, you accept the the oppressive terms and conditions of real life!
It's like bowing down to Big Brother and accepting all the doubleplusungood doublethink that brainwashes you into a completely mindless zombie! The quote I mentioned above reveals another terrifying-beyond-comprehension piece of
fridge horror that I could barely bear without going insane! It means the all those innocent people who are forced to suffer all those horrible sh*t that goes on in the world are being sacrificed for the sake of forcing us to be grateful!
Sacrificing our happiness and everything important to us just for something as inanely simple as gratitude or any other important life lesson is atrociously retarded!!!!
The price of all those important life lessons like appreciation of the simple things in life is disproportionately enormous and overinflated to oblivion!
It's like literally having to pay a million dollars for just one loaf of bread! This motherf*king atrocious rule <b>MUST BE DISCONTINUED FOR GOOD!!!!!!</b>
</p>
I just can't believe that there are lots of people in the world who embrace and glorify all the bad things in life like an orphan who worships a terrible criminal who killed his parents in the most brutal way possible!
I assure you, that I will <b>NEVER EVER</b> join Big Brother and accept his oppression! Just like how Luke Skywalker will never join the Dark Side!

<br><strong style="color:gray font-size:150%">And neither should you!</strong></img>
All of this absurd irrationality should never have existed to begin with!!!!! Now I want to drop a gargantuan F-bomb as big as the Tsar Bomba! All this ranting makes me really exhausted, so I'm going to have to rest tomorrow, and throw my sh*tty pants and undies in the laundry when I wake up.
Goodbye for today.
