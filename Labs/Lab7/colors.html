        To start your day, let's compare two sets of <b>cyan boxes.</b> One row is colored using <b>RGB</b> and the other is colored with <b>HSL</b>.<br>
        Can you tell the difference between the first row of boxes and the second row?
    </p>
    <span style="font-size:150%">RGB (top row) vs. HSL (bottom row)</span>

    <b>It's good to look at some thought-provoking riddles like this box riddle! </b><i>I hope you like puzzles and other stuff to enrich your mind!</i>
    <p>
        Tell me what you observe about these boxes. <i>Hint: the boxes are more transparent the further right you go.</i>
        Are you stuck? Then here's another hint: <i>The increase of transparency is constant over every iteration and is the same over both rows.</i><br>
        Do you want the answer?
        <b>There is no difference in color between both rows of boxes. They may use different systems of color representation, but they end up the same color.
        This is because I colored the boxes with the equivalent of cyan for both systems.</b><br>
        If you guessed no, congratulations! <b>You win all the cyan boxes!</b> You might as well guess what kinds of cool stuff I put in these boxes...<br>
        Let's open one of them and see what's inside! *drumroll*
    </p>

<p>
    It's the American Flag!!! <b>*Plays "The Star-Spangled Banner" very loudly*</b><br>
    Do you remenber the <b>tailgate party</b> we had on day three? We had a great time, didn't we?
    Did you enjoy the snacks I brought, like the chips, cookies, sandwiches and ice cream?
    If you did, <b>bonus points for you!</b> What was your favorite team? I hoped you enjoyed the football match.
    Now you can have the <b>patriotic</b> American flag in your home! How cool is that?!
