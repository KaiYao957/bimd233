<h2>Time to get back to another day with talking about random stuff with you.</h2>
<h3>Did you enjoy my talk about flying in airplanes yesterday? I hoped you liked flying in an airplane and relaxing.
    And if you booked me to a good flight or are willing to bring me to a flight you will board, I will be grateful beyond belief.</h3>

        But first, let's look at the weather forecast today. It's not only important to check the weather for any dangerous natural events, but also
        to figure out what activities are suitable in today's weather conditions. So why not we take a look at a recent weather forecast of the last several days?
        Perhaps we can find out what kind of stuff we can do today, or at least just look at the weather outside to enjoy nature. We can spend some leisure time just to
        appreciate the weather while having a conversation.

    Looks like we're going to have some colder weather that is good for a little bit of outdoor activity like walking, but mostly for staying indoors just to gossip
    in the cool outdoors, while we have some good leisure time. Besides, I'll let you use a simple little machine for fun on the next page. Enjoy the leisure time, till I get the machine ready.
