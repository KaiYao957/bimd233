    <h3>Now that we've finished with our weather report, we can spend some time indoors for some fun.</h3>
    <p>
        While indoors, let's enjoy some rest and relaxation. We can look outside to enjoy the calmming nature outdoors, while we gossip
        and contemplate our lives with each other. It would also be great to light a fire in the fireplace for some warmth. We can also play a few board games
        together, and have some good leisure time. Maybe we can also bake cookies or cook a warm and delicious meal for each other and have our conversation on the dining table.
        But now, I want to show you this simple little machine for you to play. It comes an instruction manual to tell you how it works. (Besides, every machine
        needs an instruction manual attached to show you how to use it.) So here is the instruction manual:
    </p>
    <p>
        Machine intsructions: <br>
        Once you activate the machine by pressing the button, enter a command to switch states. The machine will start at idle. Type "exit" to turn off the machine.<br>
        <ul>Navigation:
            <li>Idle, "run" -> S1</li>
            <li>S1, "next" -> S2</li>
            <li>S1, "skip" -> S3</li>
            <li>S1, "prev" -> S4</li>
            <li>S2, "next" -> S3</li>
            <li>S3, "next" -> S4</li>
            <li>S3, "home" -> Idle</li>
            <li>S4, "next" -> S1</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
<button onclick="activateMachine()">Operate Machine</button>
<br>
<span>Go ahead and enjoy the rest of our leisure time by playing with our simple little machine or other leisure activities together. See you later.</span>
