<span>So here we go!!!</span>
  <p>
    First off, we'll start of with <b style="color:lime">*lightsaber sound* Star Wars!</b>
    Let us return to the <em style="color:gold; font-size:125%">galaxy far, far away</em> and watch the video!<br>

  <p>
    Star Wars was so awesome, right?! <em style="color:gold; font-size:125%">Hope you're a lightsaber-wielding fan or a Jedi!</em>
    Too bad everyone's so divided over Star Wars like the <strong>political climate</strong> today. People keep calling Rey a <strong style="font-size:25px; color:violet">Mary Sue</strong>
    and all that nonsense. <em style="color:gold; font-size:125%">Anyway, may the Force be with you!</em>

    Thanks for watching! If you like videos, here's a <strong>bonus</strong> one for you!<br>
    Here's your bonus gift! It's <strong style="color:fuchsia">Nyan Cat!!!</strong>!!!<br>
    <video src="video/Nyan cat.ogv" poster="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/005/608/nyan-cat-01-625x450.jpg" width="400" height="300" controls preload loop></video>
    <br>
    If you don't know what Nyan Cat is, or if you are uninitiated with Internet memes, it's a video of a cat with a Pop-tart for a body flying through space with a rainbow behind it!
    And it makes the cute "nyanyanyanya" sound everywhere it goes! Isn't it cute??? *wink* :)
  </p>
  <span>I hope you enjoyed the videos! Good luck, and have a nice day!</span>
