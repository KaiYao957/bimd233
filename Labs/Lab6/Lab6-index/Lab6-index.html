<p>I really like the UW bookstore. It's got all sorts of awesome books and fascinating stuff to read! Did you enjoy any of the cool books there? Did you go to the nearby ice cream store? If so, what flavors did you like? Did you get three in a row in tic-tac toe? If you did, congratulations! You're a winner! 
  <span style="color:lightgray">(Or if you like pop culture, a winner is you!) *applause*</span>
  </p>
  <b style="color:rgb(0, 216, 0)">Did you know that the word "book" came from the beech tree? Good to know some etymology and other interesting facts!</b>
  <p>
    Anyway, for today, we shall enjoy watching some cool media! <span style="color:lightgray">(Along with references to pop culture, if you really like it)</span>
    <ul>Here's the media... *drumroll*
      <li><a href="Lab6-songs\Lab6-songs.html">Here is some audio for you to hear.</a></li>
      <li><a href="Lab6-video\Lab6-video.html">And here are some videos.</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <span style="font-size:20px; font-family:calibri; color:navy">Enjoy the media! (And I hope you brought some snacks so that we can enjoy them together.)</span>
