  <h3>I knew this was going to be an interesting list for you, so I might as well show it.</h3>
  <p>
    This time, I'm going to talk about books! I learned that you loved reading ever since I mentioned my favorite bookstore, remember?
    Therefore, I shall show you a list of some very useful and important books that will help you be successful. Even better, these books are endorsed
    by one of the most famous computer and technology businessmen and billionaire, Bill Gates! Hope you enjoy learning some intersting and useful information through these books!
    (Dammit, I should seriously go to the local library with you soon. That way we can enjoy a great chat while reading our favorite books! :) )
