  <h3>We now return to a fresh new day to continue where we left off.</h3>
  <p>Yesterday, we went over the very basics of how to use lists. This time I'll give you a list that should be quite fun to view.</p>
  <p>
    This is a list about pets! Lovely little pets! Aren't they cute? Of course, it's not going to teach you much, but we need a little humor every now and then, right?
    In fact, I'm just using this list to practice JavaScript so that I can learn to use it well someday. So here is the list of pets that I will show you right to our room.
    Go ahead and pet them if you like. Oh, and one last question: What is your favorite pet?
