  <h3>Did you have fun with me playing the button-pressing game?</h3>
  <p>
    It looks like we had a lot of fun together. How many times did you win? If you won more rounds than me, I'd be jealous! I'd still congratulate you for a change!
    But we need to learn how to use lists so that we can learn how to get more organized with doing fun activites, or even more importantly, get more organized with our lives?
    Here's a sample list for you. As you hover your mouse over the items shown, they will turn on if you hover the cursor over them, and off when you move away form them.
    Test it out and see.
  </p>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="panel panel-default">
      <div class="panel-heading">
        <h3 class="panel-title">MOUSEOVER LIST</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li id='selected' class="list-group-item">Activated</li>
          <li id='deselected' class="list-group-item">Inactive</li>
          <li id='deselected' class="list-group-item">Inactive</li>
          <li id='selected' class="list-group-item">Activated</li>
          <li id='deselected' class="list-group-item">Inactive</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p>Tomorrow I'll be going step by step with you on how to use lists snd other useful features. For now, we can do a little bit of leisure activity and get some rest. Good luck.</p>
