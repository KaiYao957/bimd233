<h2>We are back to have another day of gossiping and talking about stuff in the world.</h2>
<p>
    Yesterday we've been checking the temperature outside to not only stay well-informed about the weather, but also to decide the most appropriate activities.
    We decided to stay indoors to have some indoor fun, doing leisure activites witch each other. What activities did you participate with me in? And what activities did you like?
    Did you like baking cookies, having dinner, admiring scenery, or perhaps, playing some games? Maybe you liked the fireplace? And what about the simple little machine
    that I let you play with? Did you like it? I hoped you had a relaxing time talking with me. Anyway, let's get talking about another subject, shall we?
</p>
<h3>Today we're going to talk about stocks as well as companies and corporate financial stuff.</h3>
<p>
    Corporate fiscal matters are a pretty big deal, because... capitalism! Capitalism is the lifeblood of the American economy, so it's pretty important to check
    the stock market, company comparisons, etc. to keep checking the state of the economy. Here is a list of the top 10 companies in our local area. Are there any
    companies you find familiar or interesting? Maybe we should seriously start discussing economics and finances, as well as business and companies. Here's the table
    of the top companies in our area.
</p>

<span>Have you found my talk about business economics interesting, or at least, useful? Go ahead and tell me about whay you learned. Thank you for participating in this conversation.</span>
