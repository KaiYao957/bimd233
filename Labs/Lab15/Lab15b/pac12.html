    <h3>We're back to enjoy our quiet day lounging at home.</h3>
    <p>Have you been enjoying our peaceful and relaxing day? I hoped you learned something important about corporate economics earlier today.
        Do you feel bored right now? I was worried you'd be bored while we enjoyed our leisure time together. I've learned that you like sports very much ever
        since I invited you to a tailgate party. So let's turn on the TV and watch a sports channel, shall we? We're going to watch a nice football match!
        Here's a nice table for you that shows the status of the local football game. Click the button provided to see the results so far! Which team do you think would win?
        Check the table and find out!
    </p>

  <p>That was a long day, wasn't it? Tomorrow we'll be playing a really fun game for us to play! But now, it's time for us to go to sleep, and together we can share our dreams. Good night!</p>
