<h2>
    We are back again with another episode of lab practice. I hope you're ready, because it's going to be about airplane flights.
    Have you slept enough? I hope you did, because everyone needs a good night's sleep. My mom always urges me to sleep early, because she wants me to have enough
    energy and stay healthy.

    I really hoped you enjoyed that 3-parter yesterday. It was pretty funny, with me using JavaScript to talk about random stuff.
    I also talked about TV shows and multi-part episodes a little, from the very beginning. Did you enjoy that part? Because it's interesing to talk about TV shows
    once in a while, like an expensive and super-delicious snack! But now let's talk about airplane flights!
</h4>
    <p>
        Do you ever wish you could fly like a bird? If you said so, you're not alone; nearly every child dreams of flying in the bright blue sky, as well as
        fantasize about having fun flying around. That's why daydreaming is called "having one's head in the clouds"; flying offers us a great sense of freedom
        to explore anywhere we want. There is one vehicle that allows us to fly in the sky while bringing us the pleasurable comforts of today: airplanes! That's right,
        if you ever listened to what I said about cars last time, airplaned also have the same awesomeness value plus the obvious ability to fly! (Everything's better with flying, you know.)
        That's why I'm going to show you a table of some of the more recent flights for you!
    </p>
<table class="table" id="flight-table"></table>
    <p>
        Every flight in an airplane provides a long trip through the sky, allowing us to admire the beauty of the sky itself while offering lots of
        modern conveniences that provide us with great comfort and pleasure. They even provide us with the opportunity to watch some recent, tending movies while
        we relax in our seats. Maybe one day, we can all go take a long flight and enjoying watching the sky. Besides, it's also pretty cool to visit an airport and
        explore its adventurous appearance.

    <b>Thank you very much for listening to what I have to say about flying in an airplane! If you ever have plans to go flying on a plane, I hope you enjoy the ride!</b>
