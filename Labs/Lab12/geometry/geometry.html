    Thank you very much. But now we should get ready to look at a little bit of geometry, shall we?
    We're just going to look at circles and we'll be done. Right? But wait, there's more. This page is only one of a three-parter!
    That's right, like a three parter episode of a TV show or something like that. Can't forget the rule of three nor the longer-than-usual episode
    of a TV show that seems to be the norm of TV shows these days (and have always been since the early days of TV shows). Sooner or later, we're going to face a moment
    in our lives in which an episode of our live is so much longer than usual, we might as well have to partition it into part 1, part 2, part x and so on, if
    we ever want to represent it like a normal part of our lives. Face it, we'll need to be patient to go through the longer-than-usual parts of our lives.
    Like always, I've had enough of explaining so much to you that I forget my main point. The next two parts will involve JavaScript practices with tables about cars, and timers.
    (And if you were patient enough listening to my schmoozing about multi-parters without a tantrum, bonus points for you!) Time to show you the circle info!

<!-- Information about circles -->
<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">
<p>
    Circles make the world go round, because they are one of the most important shapes in the universe. (Pun intended, because circles are literally round. The most important thing about a circle is that it's round.)
    There is a unique number associated with the roundness of the circle, known as, you guessed it, pi. Pi, the ratio of the circumference (the length around the circle) to the diameter (the length across the circle),
    is one of the most important irrational numbers, with a value of approximately 3.14159. Highly advanced computers have computed pi to as many digits as possible to test their amazing power.
    There's a reason why pi rhymes with pie! Well, this "reason" I mentioned is in reality just a coincidence. That still doesn't stop us from making jokes about pi like the "pi rhyming with pie" joke.
    Did you know that Albert Einstein was born on Pi Day? (Which is by the way, on March 14) It's very fitting that one of the smartest scientists who ever lived, the guy who discovered the theory of relativity, E=mc<sup>2</sup>
    and some of the most important physics discoveries ever made, was born on the day that looks similar to one of the most important numbers known to humanity. If you want some sample data from 3 randomly generated circles,
