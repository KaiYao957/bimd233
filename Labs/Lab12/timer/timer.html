<h2>
    Now finally! *breathes a sigh of relief* We can move on to the final part of the day. And it's going to be a short one, since it's about a timer!
</h2>
<p>
    I was wondering, how much time do you usually spend on viewing one of the pages I do for lab practice? And did you remember the time I showed you some images and
    gifted you some smiley faces, showed you the location of a great bookstore, then played some tic-tac-toe with you? And did you remember the pages where I put up some media
    for you to enjoy? These were some great memories. Anyway, here's a little timer for you to contemplate the passage of time. This timer ticks in 3 second intervals
    instead of the practical 1-second ticks of every mundane timer, just for the sake of JavaScript practive. Hope that's still okay with you. Anyway, just hit the button below to
    start the timer, so that you can relax and peacefully contemplate the flow of time and our place in the universe.

<b>Phew. It was a long episode, and you're most likely tired after this three-parter episode. We should go take a well-deserved rest.</b>
