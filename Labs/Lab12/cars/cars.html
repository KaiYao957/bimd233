    Now, back to part 2 of Javascript practice. That's right, it's part two of our three-parter practice! I hoped you enjoyed my schmoozing about
    circles and the number pi. Here's a pie for you if you like. (Again, pun intended.) This time I will talk about cars, like I told you in part 1.
</h2>

<p>
    Cars, cars. They are so essential to modern life, because they not only look cool, but also provide lots of great functionality, with the main one being, of course,
    practical transportation over long distances. It's pretty cool to drive in a fancy new car, to your favorite place while listening to relaxing music on the radio.
    And it's very relaxing to rest in the back seat, frolicking or sleeping while listening to that same music I mentioned. So why not we take a look at a table of
    5 beautiful cars that might as well give us the experience? Note that the last 2 cars are not real cars, just some arbitrary models I made up for examples.
    (Unless I somehow went to the future just to look at some futuristic car models.) So here is the small yet sleek table of cars to look at.

<b>The final part of this practice session is next, so let's take a break for a while.</b>
