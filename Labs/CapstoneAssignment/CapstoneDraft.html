<h2>Welcome! I know you've been enjoying the funny and cool stuff that I have been making during my web design practice.
    I hoped you liked my sense of humor! Thank you very much for your appreciation!</h2>
<h2>That's why I am going to confess to you about what I like to do with web design, and how I'm going to show my talents using web design.</h2>
<div>
<p>
    Ever since I attended Web Design class, I've developed an interest in web design. It's not only so fun, but also it has lots of incredibly useful applications
    for today's technology-driven world. It truly resonates with my spirit of learning to contribute to society, because of its increadible array of applications,
    such as (obviously) creating websites, providing useful information with a well-designed interface, etc. I'd like to have a job related to information technology as my career eventually.
    It also feels easy to me because it involves logical thinking and reasoning skills, abilities that I am good at using, as well as application of computer science
    and coding skills I learned in my first year at UW. I feel more driven and motivated to do web design, because it resonates with my passion to contribute to society through
    its numerous applications I mentioned above.
</p>

<p>
    Web design, along with computer science, are some of the most fundamentally important subjects for any tech career worth its salt.
    I was wondering, what kinds of things would you like to do with web design? Web design is not just for creating awesome, becautiful websides, you know.
    There are so many useful professional applications for web design, that I couldn't possibly explain all of them in one page, let alone two. It can be used to make
    well-organized interfaces, add visual appeal and neatness to enhance user experince, provide useful information in a systematic and flowing manner,
    develop innovative interactive media, and other useful ways for users to interact with today's technology. And I plan to eventually apply what I've learned
    from web design to drive me forward to a tech career that applies my technological passion for productive purposes, such as developing innovative and useful
    programs and applications, designing useful high-quality content, managing and providing information, and other uses of applied technology.

<p>
    For all those reasons, my final project for this class is to make the most intricate webpage I can with all the skills I've learned. I will show off my
    talent and skill with web design in the best way I could possibly do, showing everything that I've learned from this class. This way, I can prove to tech
    professionals what kinds of powerful magic I can do with my web design knowledge, like a rite of passage for anyone wanting a career in the tech industry. I'll also provide my usual sense of
    humor to add some extra spice on the webpage. In conclusion, I will make my final project a display of all the most useful skills I've learned, combined neatly
    into a webpage describing my favorite stuff with lots of funny humor, and organized, professional elements. Thank you very much for listening and reading.
