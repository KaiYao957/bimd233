<h1>Welcome to my final capstone project! Our last meeting for Web Design class is finally here!</h1>
<h2>
    Did you remember what I said I was going to do for that capstone project? I thank you for all the fun and all the companionship that you've participated in with me!
    So let us celebrate with our new page for this awesome moment that we can enjoy together like a great party!
</h2>
<h3>Enjoy our day-long conversations and activities!</h3>
<hr> <!--Part 1-->
<h2 id="part1">
    Here is the first part of our web design finale! (Final episodes for TV shows and series almost always have to be multi-parter episodes, don't they?
    Because they have to be epic and thus greater than anything done before in scale, so it'd make sense for them to be pretty big! Plus, making the final episode a 
    multi-parter adds to the suspense and drama by making us wonder what happens next. :) )
</h2>
<p>
    Part one of any celebration worth its weight in gold needs to include a great meal, tasty and healthy! So let's get started with making a good meal for ourselves, shall we?
    You can choose what you'd like to eat from the jumbotron below, or you can just cook whatever you like. Either way, we can have a great conversation together while eating delicious food!
    (And yes, even my research writing class talked about food, its main topic being how food relates to culture. Eating food together is a great way to socialize in social gatherings like parties!
    Also, what's your favorite food and why is it your favorite? What makes it so delicious?)
</p>
<h3>Here is today's menu of delicious food to eat.</h3>

<h2 id="part2">Now that you've ordered your favorite meal, let's proceed to the next part our celebration.</h2>
<p>
    Looks like this is going to be real fun, especially when we do it together while eating our delicious cafe meals!
    We're going to enjoy our time together with lots of <strong>pop culture</strong> and <strong>entertainment.</strong>
    Ever since my early days of practicing web design, I've learned that you love pop culture very much. What are your most favorite
    media franchises and pop culture icons? And what are your favorite fictional stories and what are your favorite story genres? I'd love to know what kinds to stories we can enjoy together!
    <em>Oh, I wonder what kind of movies you would really like.</em> Why not we watch some trailers for some awesome movies that have been coming out recently?
    Tell me which trailer you liked the most, what made it so interesting, and why you liked it. One day, we can go out to the theaters to watch the movies you like!
    (Or we can just watch them on Netflix, or on a Blu-ray player or some other medium.) Anyway, enjoy the trailers!

                    and soul of trend-making site BuzzzTube.

                    heroics of “normal” life. It’s a tough transistion for everyone, made tougher by the fact that the family is still unaware of baby Jack-Jack’s

                    a way to work together again—which is easier said than done, even when they’re all Incredible.

<hr><!--Part 3-->
<h2 id="part3">Those movie trailers were awesome, weren't they? Now we can go to the <strong>REALLY</strong> fun part: <strong>VIDEO GAMES!</strong></h2>
<p>
    That's right, you heard me. We're going to talk about video games! <em>Woohoo!!!</em> At the same quarter I was taking web design class, I also took a class about
    game development and managed to create a simple fighting game with my team, which involves playing a series of exercise minigames to improve different player attributes
    before the player fights the opponent. Pretty cool, isn't it? Not to mention that I learned a lot about the game development process and what makes a game a "game".
    But now, we can enjoy talking about the video games we like! Video games are not only super fun, they also are a great way to socialize with friends and evoke the most sublime
    part of your spirit. What platform do you usually prefer to play video games on? Xbox? PlayStation? Or maybe the Nintendo Switch? (I hoped you enjoyed the Nintendo Switch that I offered you as a gift!
    What kinds of cool games did you play on it, and why did you like them?) Or maybe the PC? And what are some of the best games you've ever played? What are your favorite video game characters?
    I might as well play some of your favorite games if you can tell me! But right now I want to tell you about <em>Steam</em>, one of the best PC gaming platforms out there.
    It's got <strong>tons and TONS</strong> of awesome games out there for you to play! So why not download it for free? That way, we can play our favorite video games with each other over our PCs!
    (Or if you've already downloaded Steam, then go ahead and let us play!) Here are some of the best games, in my opinion, to buy on Steam:
</p>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" id="tabletoggle">Open/Close Table</button>
<table class="table" id="gametable"></table>
<p>
    <strong>Whoa!</strong> I almost forgot that it's going to be <em>Christmas</em> a few weeks from now! Now it's the perfect time to shop for games this holiday season
    for some really good deals! Keep your eyes peeled for winter/Christmas sales to buy whatever gifts you desire, for the sake of cheap prices for lots of fun! Maybe it's time to sing
    <q>Twelve Days of Christmas</q> to get into the holiday spirit! (Or we can sing our own parodies of 12 Days of Christmas to express our joy!) It's also great to read
    a few Christmas stories, or even better, make our own Christmas stories to add more of that Xmas flair! And to top it all off, we can indulge in lots of awesome Christmas-related
    activities like setting up and decorating a Christmas tree, hanging stockings, building snowmen and having snowball fights, doing Christmas arts and crafts, and the best part,
    playing video games with each other, especially the games that we would buy for Christmas! And I hope I get to see you on Christmas so that we can enjoy these activities together!
</p>
<hr><!--Part 4-->
<h2 id="part4">
    Finally! It's time to wrap things up and reflect on our time together. This is it! The final part of our celebration!
</h2>
<p>
    We're near the end of our celebration, and we've sure been enjoying the Christmas hype leat section! Well, dont' get too hyped about all
    the exciting stuff for Christmas. Not only would you eventually be faced with great dissapointment for boarding the hype train that derails and crashes
    from the enourmous amount of hype, like what happened with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/">No Man's Sky,</a> especially
    considering the ending when you go to the center of the galaxy, it's also pretty naughty, and all you'll get would be a disappointing mountainful of <strong>coal.</strong>
    Like every other naughty children on Christmas! Anyway, here's some awesome pieces of classical music that are very fitting for great celebrations...
    because they've been played specifically to celebrate grand events. You might as well play them while we schmooze about our time together.
    They're the perfect music to listen to while having a long chat about all the cool thigs about ourselves!

            <em>Ode to Joy.</em> Yes, that masterpiece by Ludwig van Beethoven is the perfect thing to play when you've finally
            completed a major life goal. Its high-pitched vocals provide the uplifting atmosphere of accomplishment to eveyone who hears it.
            It is so grandoise, that you might as well play it after you've overcome such a difficult challenge, such as defeating
            <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">that one video game boss that was so frustratingly hard</a>
            you might as well have rage quitted the game because <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain">it killed you like Kenny so many times.</a>

            Did you remember that epic song that played at you high school/college graduation? That's Edward Elgar's <em>Pomp and Circumstance,</em>
            the perfect congratulations song that is very fitting to play after you've won such a great challenge and completed your heroic quest.
            (Speaking of graduations, what was your experience of it like? How did it make you so happy, giving that rewarding sense of achievement?)
            It sounds so much like a credits theme for a movie/video game, that it might as well be played at a video game ending, especially in an action-adventure
            or RPG game when you've completed the game by defeating the final boss. Speaking of that, what video games have you beaten, and thus got to the ending?
            How did it feel when you've finally completed the game? And what did the ending feel like? I'd love to know! :)

            If you have a taste for victorious-sounding music, here's Tchaikovsky's <em>1812 Overture!</em>
            Commonly played at military parades, this glorious-sounding musical piece is the perfect thing to play
            after a major victory in life. <br> <strong>Warning: this piece features incredibly loud cannon sounds near the end.
            While it enhances the grand sense of victory over a great adversary, it is so deafeningly loud that it can scare and overwhelm
            those who are easily disturbed by loud noises. For the sake of protecting your ears, please bring earplugs if you are sensitive to noise.</strong>

        I would like to confess not only my thoughts about our time together, but also I would like to reveal more about my future tech career.
        When I first met you through my first web design pages, I noticed that you had an appreciation of my sense of humor in my pages. I also liked
        how you were having lots of fun with me with our daily routines. Since then I've learned a lot of cool things about you. You and me not only
        share a very funny sense of humor and a great interest with each other, but also, we've realized the importance of a good friendship through doing
        things we've enjoyed with each other, and we have developed a greater appreciation of our friendship from the thing we've learned together.
        I give my honest and sincere thanks to you for all the good times we've spent together.
    </p>
    <p>
        And about my plans for a technology-related career - I'm not entirely sure what kind of tech job I would have, but I will accept any tech job worth its salt,
        as long as it pays me a decent amount of money, something that utilizes my passions and skills very well, and is within my ability to handle as well as
        something I meet the requirements for. I would start off with testing and quality asurrance jobs, because I not only have a keen eye for observation that allows me to
        gather useful information and detect anything abnormal or needs improvement, but also because it gives me a sense of contribution and teamwork, and allows me to learn more
        about the tech development process as well as improving my tech skills. Maybe after I've gained more experience with the tech industry I could get a job with
        actual job with tech development, and work for a development team. In my earlier draft, I promised to you that I would not only discuss my career plans for the future, but also How
        my experience with web design relates to it. I crafted this page with skilled consciseness and experienced talent, to show off all that I have learned from web design
        class. Were you observing the interactive elements of this page and thinking about how they work, as well as the visual design of this page and all of its constituent elements?
        The key here lies in the skills I've developed and honed through lab practice and useful information I've gathered online, as well as my teacher's lectures.
        If you've been having a lot of fun with my sense of comedic humor, and looking at how everything is neatly organized and visually appealing, then you might as well
        wonder how I was able to make it that way. <q>What kind of magic is this?</q>, you might ask. To be very honest with you, I personally designed this page with all the
        web design knowledge I've gained in class, combined with my natural intelligence, reasoning, and my understanding of technology and computers.
        Here are three life lessons that I have gained a greater understanding of through this class that I want you learn with your heart:
        <ol>
            <li>
                If you're not sure with what job or career you'd like to pursue, assess your talents, skills, experience, and passions to see what career paths would fit best for you,
                annd see if you can find any jobs that are practical for your life.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want to understand how something interesting works, analyze it critically and break it down to understand more about how it works,
                and make critical observations to obtain useful information about how it is the way it is. Think about how the information logically goes together

        Thank you very much for viewing my web design work, and all the friendship you've nurtured with me. I am very grateful that I met you and
        that I enjoyed my time with you. It has been a great pleasure to socialize with you, share my interests with you, and most importantly, to learn from you.
        For that reason, I sincerely grant you my deepest gratitude. As a token of appreciation, I will gift you a choice of 3 games for the Nintendo Switch I gifted you,
        out of a collection of 6. As this is the last time I meet you at Web Design class, take these games as a gift of my utmost gratitude. I don't know
        when we will meet again, but I hope I can see you and have some time with you again. :)
    </p>
    <h2>Here are the choices of Nintendo Switch games that you can choose as a gift. (You can select up to 3 out of 6 as a gift.) Farewell, and I hope to meet you again.</h2>

        The End. (I know that this is a really cliched phrase to place at the end of books, movies, and video games, just like "once upon a time"
        and "they lived happily ever after" in fairytales, but trust me, it has the classic feeling that brings about a sense of resolution that
        makes us all appreciate the story.)
