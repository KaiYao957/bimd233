<h2>Welcome to my very first JavaScript page!</h2>
<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid" style="background-color: dodgerblue; font-family: calibri">
<p>
    Unlike my other pages, this page won't be so arbitrarily long, for practice reasons. We can stil have fun with short pages however! :)
    It's time for you to reveal your true self! Why not type your username & password so that I can remember you? I know we've done stuff like this before, but this time
    we can truly share our identities and together, and can have not only lots of fun together, but also a great deal of learning and everything!
    Did you think that I used Bootstrap very well? Good! So why not log in below so that I can share more of my like and everything with you?
</p>
<button onclick="logIn()">Log In</button>
<p id="login" style="color: beige; font-size: 1.2em">Login Info:<br></p>
<br>
<strong style="color:salmon; font-size:1.5em">If you ignored that friendly popup message that appeared after you, thank you for sharing!
    (If you did read that popup message, sorry for being redundant, but anyway thank you.)</strong>
